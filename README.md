**ClimateLearn** is a Python library for accessing state-of-the-art climate data and machine learning models in a standardized, straightforward way. This library provides access to multiple datasets, a zoo of baseline approaches, and a suite of metrics and visualizations for large-scale benchmarking of statistical downscaling and temporal forecasting methods.

## Getting Started

### Installation

**conda** is required. We recommend installing [**miniconda**](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). 

First, create a conda environment and install Python3 and the conda-only dependencies.
```console
$ conda create -n cl_env -c conda-forge xesmf python=3.10
```

Then install the rest of the library with **pip**.
```console
$ pip install git+https://github.com/aditya-grover/climate-learn.git
```
